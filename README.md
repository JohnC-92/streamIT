## Server Bandwidth Usage Analysis with/without CDN

### Media Server Specs (AWS EC2): 
    OS:	 x64_linux_4.14.181-142.260.amzn2.x86_64
    CPU:	 1 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2676 v3     @ 2.40GHz
    Memory:	 983 MB
    Node.js: v14.5.0

### Start of Node Media Server - 0 Viewer
![](https://i.imgur.com/GkI7hxm.png)

    - 0 HTTP request
    - Server output bandwidth = 6 mbps.

### Node Media Server without AWS Cloudfront(CDN) - 25 Viewers
![](https://i.imgur.com/WH6ogW4.png)

    - 25 HTTP requests (1 request for every viewer)
    - Server output bandwidth = 200+ mbps.

### Node Media Server with AWS Cloudfront(CDN) - 25 Viewers
![](https://i.imgur.com/G4ST7eg.png)

    - 1 HTTP requests 
    - Server bandwidth = stable 10 mbps.

### Observation
- As we can see from the bandwidth usage, without using CDN all viewer will request video from server thus increasing server burden on uploading bandwidth.
- By using AWS Cloudfront(CDN), it effectively reduced server bandwidth by making only one request to server and serve them through it's own CDN servers.
